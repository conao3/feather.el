* Description
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conao3/files/master/blob/feather.el/feather-dashboard-teaser.gif]]

~feather.el~ is a wrapper for ~package.el~ that supports parallel fetching/byte-compiling.

It have already prepared front end for [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el][leaf.el]] in leaf-keywword.el, and you can seamlessly manage Emacs packages with ~feather.el~.

When ~feather-mode~ is enabled, ~feather.el~ advices ~package-install~ in ~package.el~.
So, all installation using ~package.el~ is handled by ~feather.el~.

~feather.el~ is a ~package.el~ wrapper that supports parallel fetch/byte-compilation.
When ~feater-mode~ is enabled, ~feather.el~ sets advice to ~package-install~, handles all package installations, and executes them asynchronously.
Originally conceived as a completely new package manager,
but in the middle of development it was thought that simply handling ~package-install~ would be sufficient to achieve the goal,
so it provides your Emacs with a powerful asynchronous installation that preserves the ~package.el~ experience.

* Install
~feather~ is available via ~el-get~
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (leaf feather
    :el-get conao3/feather.el
    :config (feather-mode))
#+end_src

* Usage
Just enable ~feather-mode~ and install some package via ~package.el~ (~package-install~, ~list-package~,,,)

* Notice
~feather~ sets the advice to run ~package-install~ asynchronously.
That is, ~package-install~ returns the moment it is executed, and the subsequent S-exp is executed (if any).
Therefore, the following configuration will result in an error.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-install 'leaf-keywords)
  (leaf-keywords-init)
#+end_src

If you want execute ~leaf-keywords-init~ after ~leaf-keywords~ is installed as intended, you need to register an S-exp with ~father~.
This allows ~feather~ to execute the registered S-exp after the package is installed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-install 'leaf-keywords)
  (feather-add-after-installed-hook-sexp leaf-keywords
    (leaf-keywords-init))
#+end_src

However, this is generally cumbersome, so the easiest solution is to use [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el][leaf]].
Using the ~:feather~ keyword as a trigger, the S-exp that should be executed after the package is installed is automatically registered with the ~feather~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (leaf leaf-keywordsq
    :feather t
    :config (leaf-keywords-init))
#+end_src

If you want to switch to a feather install for all the ~:ensure~ keywords, you can do so by setting ~leaf-alias-keyword-alist~.
With ~leaf-alias-keyword-alist~ is ~((:ensure . :feather))~, the leaf block below has the same meaning as a leaf block using the ~:feather~ keyword.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (leaf leaf-keywords
    :ensure t
    :config (leaf-keywords-init))
#+end_src
